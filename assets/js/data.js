    shortBio: "🚀 Passionate about building intelligent systems and impactful web applications. I’m a B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, eager to explore real-world use cases of AI while mastering full-stack web development. Always driven by curiosity, I strive to turn ideas into reality through code, learning, and collaboration.",
    
    fullBio: [
    "👋 Hey there! I'm **Piyush Kumar Chaurasiya** — a passionate and ambitious Computer Science Engineering undergraduate **(2025–2029)** specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. I’m driven by curiosity, fueled by creativity, and constantly inspired by how technology can solve meaningful problems around us.",
    
    "🚀 My journey in tech began with basic programming and web development, but quickly expanded into full-stack application design, cloud computing, and machine learning. I’m fascinated by how intelligent systems can enhance decision-making, automate tedious processes, and unlock powerful user experiences — and I aim to be part of building such systems that scale and serve people worldwide.",
    
    "💻 In the world of development, I enjoy building **end-to-end solutions**. From crafting sleek and responsive front-end interfaces using React or Vue, to building robust back-end APIs with Node.js or Python, I thrive in environments that challenge me to learn fast, think logically, and code cleanly. I also explore real-world AI problems — including classification models, recommendation systems, and NLP — and continuously work on side projects to strengthen both theory and practice.",
    
    "📚 I'm a strong believer in **continuous learning**, whether it's through online platforms, hackathons, developer communities, or open-source contributions. I actively follow the latest advancements in AI and software engineering and often build proof-of-concept projects, watch deep-dive tech talks, or write clean documentation and notes to reinforce my understanding.",
    
    "🧠 Outside of development, I enjoy reading about startup journeys, UI/UX case studies, and AI ethics. I believe that **soft skills** like communication, adaptability, and empathy are just as crucial as technical ability — especially when working in a team or leading others toward a common vision.",
    
    "🤝 I'm currently open to **internships, remote collaborations, freelance projects**, and **mentorship** — anything that helps me learn by doing and contribute meaningfully in return. If you're working on something exciting in the space of AI, full-stack engineering, or innovative education tech, I’d love to connect and be a part of it!",
    
    "🎯 My mission is simple: **Keep learning, stay humble, build useful things, and make a positive impact with technology.**"
